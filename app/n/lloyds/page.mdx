- In 2021, I worked as a **Research Intern** with the **[Lloyd’s Register Foundation](https://www.lrfoundation.org.uk/)**, a global charity dedicated to advancing safety innovation and education.
- I conducted a maritime technology & policy data analysis project, use the data and literature from **[Heritage & Education Centre](https://hec.lrfoundation.org.uk/)**’s digital collections to analyze current safety challenges. 
- Specifically, I studied the **Suez Canal blockage**, publishing a literature review on the topic, now available on the Heritage & Education Centre website.
