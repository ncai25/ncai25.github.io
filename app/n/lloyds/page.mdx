In 2021, I worked as a **Research Intern** with the **[Lloyd’s Register Foundation](https://www.lrfoundation.org.uk/)**, a global charity dedicated to advancing safety innovation and education.
- I conducted a maritime technology & policy research project, using data from the [Heritage & Education Centre](https://hec.lrfoundation.org.uk/)’s digital collections for sea safety analysis.
- My work included a literature review on the Suez Canal blockage, now published on the Heritage & Education Centre website. Read the **[review](https://hec.lrfoundation.org.uk/whats-on/stories/avoiding-supply-chain-bottlenecks-what-can-history-teach-us)**  here!
