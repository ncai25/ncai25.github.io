<details className="mb-1 -mt-2">
  <summary className="text-gray-600 text-[15px] mb-2">Majority: Server Components</summary>
  
    Most of the time, I fetch data in a Server Component (like a `page` or `layout`). Occasionally, I'll still use an external library for client-fetches (e.g. `swr`) when working with existing codebases.

  <summary className="text-gray-600 text-[15px] mb-2">Occasionally: React `use` + Context</summary>
  
    A newer pattern I've started using is forwarding Promises to a Context provider, and then "unwrapping" the Promise with React’s `use`.
    
    The data can then be used from a hook in any client component.
    
    This can work well if you have global data you need to use deep in the component tree (especially if there are lots of client components).

  <summary className="text-gray-600 text-[15px] mb-2">Why Tailwind?</summary>
  
  Tailwind uses a compiler to generate only the classes used. So while the utility CSS framework contains many possible class names, only the classes used will be included in the single, compiled CSS file.
  
  Assuming you only write Tailwind code, your bundle will never be larger than the total set of used Tailwind classes. It's extremely unlikely you would use them all. This means you have a fixed upper bound on the size of the generated CSS file, which is then minified, compressed, and cached for the best performance.
  
  You don't have to *only* write Tailwind styles. Tailwind classes are just utilities that adhere to a design system and work alongside normal CSS. You can mix and match Tailwind with CSS Modules, for example.
