# Printmaking

<AnimatedName />

In my free time, I like making prints and experimenting with paper techniques. 

- In spring 2023, I took a RISD class, “IDISC 2080: BUILDING PRINTS,” where I practiced techniques such as **monotype**, **soft ground**, and **collagraphy**. 
- I enjoy playing with textures, layering, and composition!
- Here are some examples from my work:

## Series 1: Marks

<div className="border border-gray-200  rounded-md p-4">
  <Image src={print1} alt="CS Symposium Poster" />
</div>

## Series 2: Colors

<div className="border border-gray-200  rounded-md p-4">
  <Image src={print2} alt="CS Symposium Poster" />
</div>

<div className="border border-gray-200  rounded-md p-4">
  <Image src={print3} alt="CS Symposium Poster" />
</div>

## Calligraphy

- I also pratice traditional Chinese calligraphy, which I’ve done since age seven.
- Here's a piece of my pratice:

<div className="border border-gray-200  rounded-md p-4">
  <Image src={calligraphy} alt="CS Symposium Poster" />
</div>
