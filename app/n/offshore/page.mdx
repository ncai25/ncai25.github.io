# Offshore Literary

<AnimatedName />

Between 2020 and 2022, I was a writer and an editer for *[Offshore](https://noracai.wixsite.com/offshore)*, a literary magazine founded in Cambridge, UK.

## About

- The primary purpose of *Offshore* is to celebrate  bicultural voices in English and Chinese without resorting to self-exoticism.
- The magazine's official accounts on [Wechat](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/8SBOfoescYvxyfeMVNTY3g) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wuan.offshore/) have 1.5k+ followers in total. Our two published issues have sold 400+ printed copies.
- I also created & designed our website. Check it out [here](https://noracai.wixsite.com/offshore)!
