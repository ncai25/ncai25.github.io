Hi! I am currently double majoring in [Computer Science](/n/coding) (AI/ML track) and [English Literature](/n/writing) at Brown University. 

I'm a Research Assistant at the [CNTR](https://cntr.brown.edu/) and an organizer at [BAIST](https://www.baist.ai/), with a keen research interest in NLP, AI safety and AI legislation.

This coming summer, I'll be working as a Software Engineer Intern at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).
