Hi! I'm a [Computer Science](/n/coding) and [English](/n/writing) double major at Brown University.

I'm a Research Assistant at the [CNTR](https://cntr.brown.edu/) and an organizer at [BAIST](https://www.baist.ai/), with a keen research interest in NLP, AI safety and AI legislation.

Previously, I’ve  worked as a SWE and Research Intern. This summer, I’ll be joining [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) as a Software Engineer Intern. More on my experience [here](/n/work).
